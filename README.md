# webpack-pug-es6 boilerplate

A Boilerplate for es6 projects.

Stack:
- Webpack, HMR
- Pug
- ES7/Babel
- PostCSS


# Why

I got into the habit of using pug as a fast templating language.  Often I would scratch up ideas and proof concepts by creating a few pug templates and some es6. I would have really liked a simple boilerplate like this one, but couldn't find one that was just right.  So I made this one.

# What

This boiler plate contains:

- Webpack, HMR
- Pug
- ES7/Babel
- PostCSS

Everything you need to code some sample code.

# What it isn't

This is not intented as a starting point to your production code.  If you are looking for something like that, trust me, there are many better choices out there.  You wont find any test code here.  This is for quick and dirty things.
